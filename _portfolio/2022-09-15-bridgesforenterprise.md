Build a GitHub-page based website template for chapters in the company to create their own website (non- programmer), involving javascript, html, css, Ruby

Open source at [here](https://tech.bridgesforenterprise.com/)

There is an increasing need for sites to cater to different audiences and different geographical locations. Most of these sites are static websites for information display only. The key requirements are that they should be easily modified by people with limited tech knowledge, that they should be hosted with minimal budget spend, and that they should be consistent with overall BfE branding guide. Our proposed way of achieving this in this project is to build a BfE-themed GitHub Page / Jekyll template, with the side products being two GitHub pages based off the template for Bridges for Charity, our sister organisation, and Bridges Initiatives, our umbrella organisation. This is suitable as they are both deemed low-bandwidth static pages in line with GitHub Page’s usage guidelines. We also consider further incorporation of storybook.js html with BfE’s standard UI system.
