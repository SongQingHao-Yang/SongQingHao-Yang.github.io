# Mini-bot Competition

![](/public/img/cur.jpeg)

Teamwork to design a robot to compete for blocks pick-ups in an arena. 

- Use CAD to assemble & design the robot
- Arduino to program the line-following algorithm [code](https://github.com/AprilSweettooth/mini_bots)
- sonic sensor to detect objects

Watch the competition recording!

# Inmoov

![](/public/img/inmoov.png)

- use ROS to create a custom message of different joint angle and send them as service to control the robot
- body part detection with webcam

See the official [website](https://curobotics.soc.srcf.net/projects/inmoov-humanoid/)

# Computer! Sort Out my PDF

![](/public/img/gnn.jpg)

Advisor: Dr. Aldo Lipani (Assistant Professor, University College London)

- Build an ML model that identifies the structure of a pdf containing multiple documents

- Use graph neural network model with packages from DGL library to resort randomly shuffled pdfs (nodes to
represent pages and links to represent their order) (article & code source not published, part of the [code](https://www.kaggle.com/code/peterys/extended-pdf-segmentation-using-gnn/notebook) here)

# Fabrica.AI winter Intern

- Validate and evaluate tf2 object detection model for the robot and fine-tuning

- Generate new dataset for training with a python generator
