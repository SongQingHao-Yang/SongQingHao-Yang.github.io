title: "Understanding the Scalability of Circuit Cutting Techniques for Practical Quantum Applications"
category: manuscripts
excerpt: 'Circuit cutting allows quantum circuits larger than the available
hardware to be executed. Cutting techniques split circuits into
smaller subcircuits, run them on the hardware, and recombine results through classical post-processing. Circuit cutting techniques
have been extensively researched over the last five years and it been
adopted by major quantum hardware vendors as part of their scaling
roadmaps. We examine whether current circuit cutting techniques
are practical for orchestrating executions on fault-tolerant quantum
computers. We conduct a resource estimation-based benchmarking
of important quantum applications and different types of circuit
cutting techniques. Our applications include practically relevant
algorithms, such as Hamiltonian simulation, kernels such as quantum Fourier transform and more. To cut these applications, we use
IBM’s Qiskit cutting tool. We estimate resources for subcircuits
using Microsoft’s Azure Quantum Resource Estimator and develop
models to determine the qubit, quantum and classical runtime needs
of circuit cutting. We demonstrate that while circuit cutting works
for small-scale systems, the exponential growth of the quantum
runtime and the classical post-processing overhead as the qubit
count increases renders it impractical for larger quantum systems
with current implementation strategies. As we transition from noisy
quantum hardware to fault-tolerance, our work provides important
guidance for the design of quantum software and runtime systems.'
