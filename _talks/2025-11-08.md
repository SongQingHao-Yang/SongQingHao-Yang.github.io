Abstract：

Classical algorithms can simulate efficiently quantum circuits throughout which the quantum state
has a positive quasiprobability representation. Recently, it was shown that the Z^n_2 Kirkwood–Dirac
(KD) distribution can simulate efficiently the operations allowed by CSS error-correcting codes.
In this talk, we map out the geometry of positive states of the Z^n_2 KD distribution. We present
both analytical and numerical results. In particular, we uncover a volume of previously unknown
bound magic states, states that are not stabilizer mixtures, yet have positive KD distribution. Our
analysis reveals that these bound states occupy approximately 0.69% of the two-qubit state space.
Compared to previous results, this constitutes a 15% increase in the volume of input states that
enable efficient classical simulation through CSS circuits.
