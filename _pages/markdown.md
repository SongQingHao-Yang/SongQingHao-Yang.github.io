A list of old projects and research I've down in the past:

# Projects:

## 2022

Advisor: Kevin Huang
Role: Cambridge Associate Director
 
Build a GitHub-page based website template for chapters in the company to create their own website (non- programmer), involving javascript, html, css, Ruby

Open source at [here](https://tech.bridgesforenterprise.com/)

There is an increasing need for sites to cater to different audiences and different geographical locations. Most of these sites are static websites for information display only. The key requirements are that they should be easily modified by people with limited tech knowledge, that they should be hosted with minimal budget spend, and that they should be consistent with overall BfE branding guide. Our proposed way of achieving this in this project is to build a BfE-themed GitHub Page / Jekyll template, with the side products being two GitHub pages based off the template for Bridges for Charity, our sister organisation, and Bridges Initiatives, our umbrella organisation. This is suitable as they are both deemed low-bandwidth static pages in line with GitHub Page’s usage guidelines. We also consider further incorporation of storybook.js html with BfE’s standard UI system.

## 2021

### Mini-bot Competition

![](/files/cur.jpeg)

Teamwork to design a robot to compete for blocks pick-ups in an arena. 

- Use CAD to assemble & design the robot
- Arduino to program the line-following algorithm [code](https://github.com/AprilSweettooth/mini_bots)
- sonic sensor to detect objects

Watch the competition recording!

- use ROS to create a custom message of different joint angle and send them as service to control the robot
- body part detection with webcam

See the official [website](https://curobotics.soc.srcf.net/projects/inmoov-humanoid/)

### Computer! Sort Out my PDF

![](/files/gnn.jpg)

Advisor: Dr. Aldo Lipani (Assistant Professor, University College London)

- Build an ML model that identifies the structure of a pdf containing multiple documents

- Use graph neural network model with packages from DGL library to resort randomly shuffled pdfs (nodes to
represent pages and links to represent their order) (article & code source not published, part of the [code](https://www.kaggle.com/code/peterys/extended-pdf-segmentation-using-gnn/notebook) here)

### Fabrica.AI winter Intern

![](/files/fabrica.jpg)

- Validate and evaluate tf2 object detection model for the robot and fine-tuning

- Generate new dataset for training with a python generator

see the progress at the [start-up](https://www.fabrica.ai/)
