I am Song-qing-hao Yang (杨宋卿皞, Peter), a first-year PhD Student at [Cavendish, Department of Physics](https://www.phy.cam.ac.uk/), at Cambridge, working with [Professor Crispin Barnes](https://www.phy.cam.ac.uk/directory/barnesc). Prior to my current studies, I completed my Bachelor's Degree and Master of Sciences at Cambridge as well.

## Research Interest

My passion lies in exploring the fascinating realm of quantum information and computation, with a particular curiosity about understanding and building quantum computers in practice, if possible. My research interests span a diverse range of topics, including Hamiltonian simulation, architectural design in fault-tolerant quantum computing, distributed quantum computation, algorithm development, and quantum machine learning. I am also intrigued by the role of magic states in enabling quantum computation.  

I thrive on collaboration and interdisciplinary work, so if our interests align, please don’t hesitate to get in touch—I’d love to connect and explore opportunities to work together!

## Start-up

In addition to academic research, my efforts are underway to explore practical applications of quantum computation in the industry. I co-founded a startup focused on **HIV-related quantum use-cases** provides an opportunity to apply quantum principles to critical healthcare challenges. As this project is still in its early stages, collaboration with like-minded researchers and industry experts is essential to our success.  

## XPRIZE

I am also participating in the [XPRIZE Quantum Challenge](https://www.xprize.org/prizes/qc-apps), a three-year global competition. This competition provides a unique platform to tackle ambitious, real-world problems through quantum technologies. I believe a well-defined use-case is the cornerstone of progress in quantum computation. It connects theoretical advancements to **tangible solutions**, guiding algorithm development, hardware design, and error mitigation techniques. Use-cases help prioritize efforts in a field with **vast potential** but **limited near-term quantum resources**, ensuring that quantum technologies address the most impactful challenges. By focusing on real-world applications, quantum computation can transition from theoretical promise to transformative impact. Discussions on potential collaborations and shared goals are highly encouraged!
