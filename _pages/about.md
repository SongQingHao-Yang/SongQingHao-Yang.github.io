I am Song-qing-hao Yang (杨宋卿皞, Peter), a first-year PhD Student at [Cavendish, Department of Physics](https://www.phy.cam.ac.uk/), at Cambridge, working with:

- [Professor Crispin Barnes](https://www.phy.cam.ac.uk/directory/barnesc) (PhD Supervisor, Cavendish Laboratory)
- [Dr David Arvidsson](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=s830IJIAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) (Industrial Supervisor, Hitachi Cambridge Laboratory)
- [Professor Prakash Murali](https://prakashmurali.bitbucket.io/) (External Supervisor, Department of Computer Science)
- [Professor Jin-Peng Liu (刘锦鹏)](https://www.jin-peng-liu.me/) (External Supervisor, Tsinghua University)

Prior to my current studies, I completed my Bachelor's Degree ([thesis here](https://songqinghao-yang.github.io/portfolio/2023-05-01-quantum-dot)) and Master of Sciences ([thesis here](https://songqinghao-yang.github.io/portfolio/2024-07-01-Quantum-Superresolution)) at Cambridge as well.

## Research Interest

My passion lies in exploring the fascinating realm of quantum information and computation, with a particular curiosity about understanding and building quantum computers in practice, if possible. My research interests span a diverse range of topics, including **Hamiltonian simulation algorithm**, **(distributed) quantum architectural design**, **resource estimation** in fault-tolerant quantum computing, **quantum metrology**, **quantum foundation**, and **quantum machine learning**. I am also intrigued by the role of magic states in enabling quantum computation.  

I thrive on collaboration and interdisciplinary work, so if our interests align, please don’t hesitate to get in touch—I’d love to connect and explore opportunities to work together!
